## 1. KOReader Statistics Backup Strategy

### Current State Analysis

KOReader stores reading statistics in `statistics.sqlite3`, containing page-by-page timing data, book completion status, and reading speed metrics. The official sync options include Dropbox, WebDAV (Koofr, Nextcloud), FTP, and custom servers. Cloud sync for statistics is separate from progress sync.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Comparative Evaluation

**Google Drive Sync:**

- **Status:** Not officially supported for statistics sync[^5][^6]
- **Issues:** Calibre users report database corruption when using Google Drive with SQLite files. The sync mechanism conflicts with SQLite's file locking[^7]
- **Verdict:** ❌ Not recommended

**iCloud Sync:**

- **Status:** Not natively supported
- **Workaround:** Requires file-level sync via iOS Files app
- **Limitations:** iOS sandboxing restrictions prevent background sync
- **Verdict:** ❌ Not recommended for statistics

**Koofr WebDAV (Recommended):**

- **Reliability:** Multiple users report stable sync for statistics[^8][^9]
- **Setup:** Free 10GB tier, WebDAV access included[^10]
- **Configuration:** `https://app.koofr.net/dav/Koofr/koreader/` as sync path
- **Success Rate:** High according to community reports[^11][^2]
- **Recovery:** Files versioning available on paid tiers
- **Verdict:** ✅ **Primary recommendation**

**Alternative: Self-Hosted WebDAV (Nextcloud):**

- **Reliability:** Good, but requires server maintenance
- **Cost:** Free if self-hosted, but needs always-on hardware
- **Complexity:** Higher than Koofr
- **Verdict:** ⚠️ Secondary option if you already run Nextcloud


### Specific Recommendation

**Use Koofr WebDAV for KOReader statistics backup**

**Setup Steps:**

1. Create free Koofr account (10GB free tier)[^9]
2. Generate application-specific password in Koofr settings
3. Create `koreader` folder in Koofr web interface
4. KOReader: Tools → Reading Statistics → Settings → Cloud Sync → Add Service
5. Select WebDAV, enter:
    - URL: `https://app.koofr.net/dav/Koofr/koreader/`
    - Username: Your Koofr email
    - Password: Generated app password
6. Test with "Synchronize now"

**Known Issues:**

- Initial sync may timeout on large databases (>5MB) - retry 2-3 times[^11][^8]
- Sync frequency: Manual only (no automatic periodic sync)[^12]
- Some devices freeze during first sync - patience required[^13]

**Confidence Level:** **High** (Multiple confirmed working implementations 2024-2025)

***

## 2. Library File Cloud Backup

### Question

This backup is separate from KOReader statistics - it's for the actual EPUB and audiobook files.

### Evaluation

**Google Drive (15GB free):**

- ✅ Large free tier
- ✅ Fast sync with desktop client
- ❌ Not suitable for Calibre database files[^7]
- ✅ **Works fine for book files only**
- **Use Case:** Backup-only, not as Calibre library location

**Koofr (10GB free):**

- ✅ WebDAV access
- ✅ Already using for statistics
- ⚠️ Smaller free tier
- ✅ Better integration with reading tools
- **Use Case:** Primary backup via WebDAV mount

**iCloud Drive (5GB free):**

- ❌ Too small for typical library
- ⚠️ iOS integration good but limited space
- **Use Case:** Not recommended unless you have paid tier


### Specific Recommendation

**Two-tier backup approach:**

**Primary: Koofr (via WebDAV mount)**

- Mount Koofr as network drive using WebDAV[^14][^9]
- Sync library files separately from Calibre-Web
- Manual sync when adding books

**Secondary: Google Drive (automated backup)**

- Use rclone or similar to backup library folder
- Schedule weekly automated backups
- Keep 2-3 versions for safety

**Integration with Calibre-Web:**

- Calibre-Web points to local library location
- Separate sync process backs up to cloud
- Never point Calibre directly at cloud-synced folder[^7]

**Confidence Level:** **High** (Standard practice, well-documented)

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ 500MB limit may be tight for reading statistics over time
- ⚠️ Inactivity pausing adds latency on wake
- ⚠️ Vendor lock-in for auth/storage features
- ⚠️ Free tier may pause at inconvenient times

**Self-Hosted PostgreSQL + PostgREST**[^45][^46][^47][^48][^49]

**Pros:**

- ✅ Full control over resources
- ✅ No storage/bandwidth limits
- ✅ No inactivity pausing
- ✅ PostgREST provides auto-generated REST API
- ✅ Can run on same server as Calibre-Web-Automated
- ✅ Better for long-term data accumulation

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Requires server setup and maintenance
- ⚠️ Need to implement authentication separately
- ⚠️ Backup strategy required
- ⚠️ More initial setup time (4-6 hours)

**Setup Complexity:**[^48][^45]

```sql
-- Create schema for reading stats
CREATE SCHEMA reading_api;

-- Example unified table structure
CREATE TABLE reading_api.reading_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  book_identifier TEXT NOT NULL,
  media_type TEXT CHECK (media_type IN ('ebook', 'audiobook')),
  session_start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  session_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  progress_percent NUMERIC(5,2),
  pages_read INT,
  listening_time_seconds INT,
  device_id TEXT,
  sync_source TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create role for PostgREST
CREATE ROLE reading_api_anon NOLOGIN;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA reading_api TO reading_api_anon;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON reading_api.reading_sessions TO reading_api_anon;
```

**PostgREST Configuration:**

```ini
db-uri = "postgres://authenticator:password@localhost:5432/reading_db"
db-schemas = "reading_api"
db-anon-role = "reading_api_anon"
```


### Schema Design Considerations

**Unified Ebook + Audiobook Structure:**

**Option A: Single Table (Recommended for MVP)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE reading_api.unified_progress (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  book_title TEXT NOT NULL,
  book_isbn TEXT,
  media_type TEXT, -- 'ebook' or 'audiobook'
  current_position NUMERIC, -- page number or timestamp in seconds
  total_length NUMERIC, -- total pages or total seconds
  progress_percent NUMERIC(5,2),
  status TEXT, -- 'want_to_read', 'reading', 'finished'
  last_sync TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  device_id TEXT,
  -- Ebook-specific
  current_page INT,
  -- Audiobook-specific
  current_time_seconds INT,
  playback_speed NUMERIC(3,2)
);
```

**Option B: Separate Tables with View**

```sql
-- More normalized, better for complex queries
CREATE TABLE reading_api.ebook_progress (...);
CREATE TABLE reading_api.audiobook_progress (...);

CREATE VIEW reading_api.unified_progress AS
  SELECT 'ebook' as type, * FROM reading_api.ebook_progress
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'audiobook' as type, * FROM reading_api.audiobook_progress;
```


### Query Performance

**Real-Time Sync from KOReader:**

- PostgREST handles 1000+ req/sec on modest hardware[^48]
- KOReader sync: ~1 request per chapter or every N minutes
- Expected load: <10 req/hour per user
- **Verdict:** Performance not a concern

**Analytics Queries:**

- Simple aggregations (total reading time, books finished): <100ms
- Complex time-series analysis: May need indexes
- **Recommendation:** Add indexes on `last_sync`, `status`, `media_type`


### Specific Recommendation

**Use Self-Hosted PostgreSQL + PostgREST**

**Rationale:**

1. **No storage limits** - reading statistics accumulate indefinitely
2. **No inactivity pausing** - always available
3. **Full control** - can optimize schema as needed
4. **Cost:** \$0 if running on existing server
5. **Integration:** Can run alongside Calibre-Web-Automated

**Setup Time:** 4-6 hours initial, 30 min/month maintenance

**Backup Strategy:**

- Daily automated pg_dump to local storage
- Weekly sync to Koofr or Google Drive (encrypted)
- Use pgBackRest or Barman for point-in-time recovery

**Schema Recommendation:**

- **Start with Option A (single table)** for simplicity
- Migrate to Option B if you need complex audiobook-specific analytics
- Store `statistics.sqlite3` JSON exports as backup in `jsonb` column

**Confidence Level:** **High** (Standard PostgreSQL + PostgREST stack, well-documented)

**Security Considerations:**

- Tailscale still authenticates your account
- Can enable 2FA for additional security
- Device approval required before network access
- Can set access control lists for specific services

**Cloudflare Tunnel Use Case:**
If you later want to **share** your library with friends/family (public access), then add Cloudflare Tunnel as complementary solution. But for personal use, Tailscale is superior.

**Confidence Level:** **High** (Tailscale is industry standard for personal VPN)

## 7. Syncthing Configuration for Multi-Device Library

### iOS Syncthing Reality Check

**The iOS Problem:**[^57][^58][^59][^60][^61]

- iOS does not allow background daemons
- Syncthing can only run when app is foreground or during limited background refresh
- Sync happens every 5-15 minutes (iOS determines interval)
- Not "real-time" sync like Android/desktop

**Möbius Sync (iOS Syncthing Client)**[^58][^62][^63]

**Functionality:**

- ✅ Port of Syncthing to iOS
- ✅ Syncs to/from iOS Files app or app sandboxes
- ✅ Background sync (limited by iOS)
- ⚠️ Background interval controlled by iOS (5-15 min typical)[^58]
- ⚠️ App updates can break configuration (iOS sandbox quirks)[^58]

**Cost:** \$5 one-time purchase for unlimited sync[^62]

**User Experience:**[^64][^58]

- Works well for infrequent sync needs
- Not suitable if you need instant sync between devices
- Best practice: Open app before reading session to force sync[^64]

**Setup Complexity:** Moderate (iOS sandboxing adds complications)

**Alternative: Siri Shortcuts Automation**[^64]

```
Shortcut: "Open Reading App"
1. Open Möbius Sync
2. Wait 15 seconds (allow sync)
3. Open Readest/KOReader
```

This ensures sync happens before reading session.

### Alternative iOS-to-Server Sync Solutions

**Resilio Sync (P2P, Not Open Source)**[^65][^57]

- ✅ Better iOS background sync than Syncthing
- ❌ Proprietary (free for personal use, but not open source)
- ✅ Faster sync in practice
- ⚠️ Less privacy control than Syncthing

**Cloud Intermediary (Google Drive / iCloud)**[^66][^67]

- ✅ Native iOS integration
- ✅ Background sync handled by OS
- ⚠️ Not direct device-to-device
- ⚠️ Requires cloud storage (you want to avoid this)

**WebDAV Direct Access**[^10][^9]

- ✅ iOS Files app supports WebDAV
- ⚠️ Manual file management required
- ⚠️ No automatic sync
- **Use case:** Manual book uploads only


### Syncthing Configuration for Desktop/Android/Server

**Optimal Folder Structure:**[^68][^69]

```
/synced-library/
├── ebooks/
│   ├── book1.epub
│   ├── book2.epub
│   └── book1.sdr/  # KOReader metadata folder
├── audiobooks/
│   └── audiobook1.m4b
└── calibre-library/  # Optional: sync entire Calibre library
    ├── metadata.db
    └── Author/
```

**Critical Settings:**[^69][^68]

- **File versioning:** Enable "Simple File Versioning" (keep 5-10 versions)
- **Ignore patterns:** Add `.tmp`, `*.part`, `*~` to prevent sync issues
- **Folder type:**
    - Server: "Send \& Receive"
    - Devices: "Send \& Receive" (if you add books on device)
    - Or "Receive Only" if server is single source of truth

**Conflict Resolution:**[^68]

- KOReader `.sdr` folders: Syncthing handles well if book files identical
- Calibre `metadata.db`: **Never sync while Calibre is running**[^7]
- If conflicts occur: Syncthing creates `.sync-conflict` files - manually merge

**FAT Filesystem Considerations (Boox Palma 2):**

- FAT doesn't preserve permissions - not an issue for book files
- Extended attributes not supported - KOReader doesn't need them
- **Verdict:** No special configuration needed


### Specific Recommendation

**Multi-Track Approach:**

**For iOS (iPhone) ↔ Server:**

- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Skip file sync entirely
    - Use Readest iOS with OPDS to download from Calibre-Web-Automated
    - Reading progress syncs via Readest sync server (built into KOReader)[^70][^71][^72]
    - Books remain on server, streamed to iOS as needed
    - **Advantage:** No iOS sync complexity
- **Option 2 (If offline sync needed):** Möbius Sync (\$5)
    - Accept iOS background limitations
    - Use Siri Shortcut to force sync before reading
    - Suitable for: Plane trips, offline reading

**For Boox Palma 2 ↔ Server:**

- **Use Syncthing Android**
    - Full background sync support
    - Real-time file watching
    - Excellent performance
    - Configuration:

```
Folder: /storage/emulated/0/ebooks/
Sync to: Server /library/boox-sync/
File versioning: Simple (5 versions)
```


**For Desktop ↔ Server:**

- **Use Syncthing**
    - Bi-directional sync
    - Keep folders paired with Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder
    - Drop new books → Auto-ingest → Appears in Calibre-Web

**Configuration Best Practices:**[^69][^68]

1. **Never sync Calibre `metadata.db` while Calibre is running**
2. Use separate Syncthing folder for "ingest" (new books)
3. Let Calibre-Web-Automated organize library
4. Sync organized library back to devices
5. Enable file versioning to recover from conflicts

**Setup Time:**

- Syncthing (desktop/Android): 30 minutes
- Möbius Sync (iOS): 1 hour (includes troubleshooting sandboxing)

**Confidence Level:** **Medium-High**

- Syncthing: High confidence for desktop/Android
- iOS: Medium (works but requires workarounds)

**Critical Insight:** Given iOS limitations, **OPDS access via Readest is superior to file sync** for your use case. Recommend skipping iOS Syncthing entirely and using network access instead.

- **Method:** Readest supports OPDS catalogs
- **Setup:** Add OPDS URL in Readest settings
- **Experience:** ✅ Works well, native OPDS support in Readest

**5. Hardcover.app Integration**[^78][^79][^80][^18]

- **KOReader:** Use Hardcover plugin (third-party)[^79][^78]
    - Manual book linking required
    - Can track progress and status updates
    - Update frequency: Every N minutes or % progress
- **Calibre-Web-Automated:** Native Hardcover metadata provider[^18]
    - Syncs Kobo shelves → Hardcover "Want to Read"
    - Tracks reading progress from Kobo
    - ⚠️ Limited to Kobo devices, not generic KOReader
- **BookPlayer:** Native Hardcover sync[^29]

**6. Audiobook Flow:**

```
Audiobook Source
    ↓
Add to Calibre-Web-Automated (supports M4B/M4A)
    ↓
OPDS or manual download → BookPlayer iOS
    ↓
Listen & sync to Hardcover (manual)
    ↓
(Future) Export stats to PostgreSQL (requires custom code)
```

**7. Statistics Export to Unified Database:**

- **KOReader:**
    - `statistics.sqlite3` accessible via file system
    - Custom script needed to parse and upload to PostgreSQL
    - Schema in SQLite: `page_stat` table with page-by-page timing[^1]
    - **Custom Code Required:** Python script to read SQLite → POST to PostgREST
- **Audiobookshelf (if migrated):**
    - REST API provides listening sessions[^37]
    - Can query `/api/me/listening-sessions`
    - **Custom Code Required:** Script to fetch API → transform → POST to PostgreSQL


### Version Compatibility

**Known Working Combinations (2024-2025):**

- KOReader 2024.07+ ✅ Calibre-Web-Automated v3.1.0
- Readest (latest) ✅ KOReader 2024.07+ via plugin[^76]
- Calibre-Web-Automated v3.1.0 ✅ PostgreSQL 14-16
- Tailscale (latest) ✅ All platforms
- Möbius Sync 1.28.0 ✅ Syncthing 1.28.0 protocol

**Version Conflicts to Avoid:**

- ❌ Calibre-Web-Automated + NFS network shares (SQLite locking)[^18]
- ⚠️ Older KOReader (<2023) + Hardcover plugin (not supported)
- ⚠️ Calibre-Web (stock) + KoSync (not included, need separate server)


### Real-World Implementation Examples

**Example Setup 1: Complete CWA Stack**[^81][^77][^73]

- User: "Eldridge" (blog.eldrid.ge)
- Stack: CWA + KOReader + BOOX Go Color 7 + KOReader Sync Server
- Result: ✅ Works well, sync reliable
- Issue: Initial OPDS setup tricky (trailing slash requirement)

**Example Setup 2: Readest Integration**[^72][^70]

- User: r/koreader community
- Stack: Readest iOS + KOReader plugin + multiple e-readers
- Result: ✅ Progress sync works across all devices
- Issue: Token expiration every 10-11 days[^70]

**Example Setup 3: Hardcover Plugin**[^82][^79]

- User: MobileRead forum
- Stack: KOReader + Hardcover plugin + Kobo Clara 2e
- Result: ✅ Status updates work
- Issue: Book linking requires manual search, ISBN matching sometimes fails


### Custom Glue Code Requirements

**Required Custom Scripts:**

1. **KOReader Statistics → PostgreSQL**

```python
# Pseudocode
import sqlite3, requests

def sync_koreader_stats():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('statistics.sqlite3')
    stats = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM page_stat WHERE last_sync > ?', [last_sync_time])
    
    for row in stats:
        data = transform_to_reading_session(row)
        requests.post('http://postgrest:3000/reading_sessions', json=data)
```

**Complexity:** Medium (2-3 hours)
2. **Audiobookshelf → PostgreSQL** (if using ABS)

```python
# Pseudocode
import requests

def sync_abs_stats():
    sessions = requests.get('http://abs:13378/api/me/listening-sessions', 
                            headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'})
    
    for session in sessions.json():
        data = transform_to_reading_session(session)
        requests.post('http://postgrest:3000/reading_sessions', json=data)
```

**Complexity:** Low-Medium (1-2 hours)
3. **Hardcover API Query** (for metadata enrichment)

```graphql
query GetBookProgress($status_id: Int!) {
  me {
    user_books(status_id: $status_id) {
      book {
        title
        cached_contributors { name }
      }
      progress_percent
    }
  }
}
```

**Complexity:** Low (GraphQL API is straightforward)[^83][^84]

### Integration Testing Checklist

✅ **Before Deployment:**

1. Test OPDS catalog access from KOReader (with trailing slash)
2. Verify KOReader sync to CWA sync server
3. Confirm Readest plugin logs in successfully
4. Test Koofr WebDAV connection from KOReader
5. Verify Tailscale works on iOS (try accessing server IP)
6. Check PostgreSQL + PostgREST responds to API calls
7. Test file upload to CWA ingest folder → auto-processing

✅ **Post-Deployment:**

1. Read 5 pages on Boox → verify sync to CWA
2. Read on iPhone Readest → verify progress appears in KOReader
3. Add book via desktop → verify appears in OPDS within 5 min
4. Test remote access via Tailscale on cellular network
5. Verify backup to Koofr completes successfully

**Confidence Level:** **High** on individual components, **Medium** on full integration (custom code needed for unified database)

***

## Final Recommendations

### Complete System Architecture

**Recommended Stack:**

1. **Library Management:** Calibre-Web-Automated v3.1.0+
2. **Statistics Backup:** Koofr WebDAV (free tier)
3. **Library Backup:** Google Drive (15GB) + Koofr
4. **Remote Access:** Tailscale (free personal tier)
5. **iOS Reading:** Readest with OPDS + KOReader plugin
6. **Boox Reading:** KOReader with Hardcover plugin
7. **Audiobook Player:** BookPlayer (Phase 1), consider audiobookshelf later
8. **Database:** Self-hosted PostgreSQL + PostgREST (Phase 4)
9. **File Sync:** Skip iOS sync, use OPDS; Syncthing for Boox ↔ Server

### Total Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost | Frequency |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Möbius Sync (optional) | \$5 | One-time |
| All other components | \$0 | Ongoing |
| **Total Ongoing** | **\$0** | ✅ Meets requirement |

### Setup Time Estimate

**Minimum Viable System:** 12-15 hours (Phases 1-2)
**Full Implementation:** 25-30 hours (All phases)
**Monthly Maintenance:** 2-4 hours

### Critical Success Factors

✅ **Start with Phase 1** - Get core working before adding complexity
✅ **Test each integration point** before moving to next phase
✅ **Document your configuration** - you'll thank yourself later
✅ **Backup before major changes** - especially Calibre library
✅ **Use Tailscale for iOS access** - skip the Syncthing headache
✅ **Defer unified database** - Get reading system working first

### Known Limitations \& Workarounds

**Limitation:** No turnkey audiobook statistics export
**Workaround:** Manual Hardcover sync or custom script (Phase 4)

**Limitation:** iOS Syncthing unreliable
**Workaround:** Use OPDS + Readest instead of file sync

**Limitation:** Hardcover plugin requires manual book linking
**Workaround:** Use ISBN-based auto-linking where possible

**Limitation:** KOReader statistics sync is manual
**Workaround:** Configure gesture for easy one-tap sync[^12]

### Maintenance Expectations

**Daily:** None (automated)
**Weekly:** Check backup status (5 min)
**Monthly:** Update Docker containers (30 min), review logs (30 min)
**Quarterly:** Optimize database, review storage usage (1-2 hours)

### Alternative Paths (If Issues Arise)

**If Calibre-Web-Automated too complex:**
→ Fall back to stock Calibre-Web + separate KOReader sync server[^85][^86]

**If PostgreSQL overhead too high:**
→ Stick with per-app statistics (KOReader SQLite, ABS database)

**If iOS OPDS doesn't meet needs:**
→ Deploy Möbius Sync but accept sync limitations[^63][^62]

**If Tailscale has issues:**
→ Use Cloudflare Tunnel (setup complexity higher but works)[^50][^51]

### Confidence Assessment

| Component | Confidence | Evidence Quality |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Calibre-Web-Automated | **High** | Multiple production deployments |
| Koofr WebDAV | **High** | Confirmed working 2024-2025 |
| Tailscale | **High** | Industry standard, excellent iOS |
| Readest + KOReader | **High** | Active development, good reviews |
| PostgreSQL + PostgREST | **High** | Standard stack, well-documented |
| Unified Statistics | **Medium** | Requires custom code |
| iOS Syncthing | **Low-Medium** | Works but significant limitations |

### Final Verdict

This architecture **meets all your requirements:**

- ✅ \$0 ongoing costs (Möbius Sync is optional)
- ✅ Open-source tools throughout
- ✅ iOS + Boox Palma 2 support
- ✅ Integrates all components
- ⚠️ Unified database requires custom coding

**Start with Phases 1-2 for immediate reading system**, defer unified database until you confirm the basic flow works well. The system is **production-ready** with the recommended stack, and you can add sophistication incrementally.

Total setup time of **12-15 hours** for MVP is reasonable for a technical architect, and the \$0 ongoing cost meets your constraint. The tools are actively maintained with strong communities, reducing long-term risk.
