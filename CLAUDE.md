# Mandatory Guidelines

## Token Efficiency
- Be effient with token use during responses to user and task workflow to maximize session progress within the allotted token limits for a Claude Pro subscription.

## Assumptions
- Do not make assumptions or new decisions. If any information is missing or a new decision point arises, ask the user for clarification, providing grounded and validated recommendations with options.

## Responses
- Provide clear and concise responses. Do not include unnecessary information or filler content.
- Avoid repetition of information already provided in the conversation.
- Do not take user's questions as fact. Be critical of suggestions and verify their validity before proceeding.

## Libraries and Tools
- ALWAYS use context7 and official documentation when developing code or answering technical questions.
- Verify all code with official documentation to ensure accuracy and best practices.
