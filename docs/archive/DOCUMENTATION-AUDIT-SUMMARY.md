## Key Findings

### Finding #1: Documentation is Healthy, Not Broken ‚úì

The project has **well-structured, standards-compliant documentation** following the BMM (Build Measure Model) workflow framework:

- **Phase 1 (Research):** Product brief + deep research (2025-10-24)
- **Phase 2 (Solutioning):** PRD + Architecture + Tech Specs (2025-10-26 to 2025-10-29)
- **Phase 3 (Planning):** Epics + Stories (2025-10-27 onwards)
- **Phase 4 (Implementation):** Active stories + setup guides (2025-10-27 onwards)

**No documentation is "wrong"‚Äîthey're just at different evolution stages.**

---

### Finding #2: Two Documents Need Sync ‚ö†Ô∏è

| Document | Role | Status | Issue |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| **docs/epics.md** | Strategic planning reference | STALE | Says Epic 1 has 3 stories; actually has 6 |
| **docs/sprint-status.yaml** | Execution tracking | CURRENT | Shows 6 stories for Epic 1 (correct) |
| **docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md** | Architecture design | CURRENT | Covers all 6 work areas (validates sprint version) |

**Root Cause:** epics.md is a Phase 2 planning artifact; sprint-status.yaml evolved during Phase 4 execution without updating the planning reference.

**Impact:** Low‚Äîsprint-status.yaml is the working document. epics.md is useful for context but can't be relied upon for execution.

---

### Finding #3: Missing Story Files (Not Missing Stories!)

**In sprint-status.yaml but not in docs/stories/:**
- Story 1.4: design-and-implement-unified-database-schema [BACKLOG]
- Story 1.5: implement-library-backup-to-separate-storage [BACKLOG]
- Story 1.6: document-calibre-cli-fallback-procedures [BACKLOG]

**Important:** These stories are NOT missing‚Äîthey're just not documented as story files yet. They exist in:
- ‚úì sprint-status.yaml (tracking)
- ‚úì tech-spec-epic-1.md (detailed design)
- ‚úó docs/stories/ (story files - to be created)

---

## Authoritative Source Hierarchy

When there's ambiguity, use this priority order:

```
1. ‚≠ê docs/sprint-status.yaml
   ‚îî‚îÄ Current execution tracking, updated daily
   ‚îî‚îÄ Source of truth for what's being built THIS SPRINT

2. ‚≠ê docs/tech-spec-epic-N.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ Detailed architectural design for each epic
   ‚îî‚îÄ Validates sprint decomposition
   ‚îî‚îÄ Goes into implementation depth

3. üìñ docs/stories/*.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ Individual story implementation files
   ‚îî‚îÄ Growing as stories are drafted and completed

4. üìö docs/epics.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ Strategic planning reference (high-level)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Useful for understanding epic scope
   ‚îî‚îÄ NOT for execution‚Äîuse sprint-status.yaml instead
```

## Reconciliation Recommendations

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (This Week)

1. **Update docs/epics.md Epic 1 section**
   - Change "3 stories" ‚Üí "6 stories"
   - Add stories 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 with full user stories
   - Add mapping table showing epic.md names ‚Üí sprint-status.yaml keys
   - **Time estimate:** 1 hour
   - **Owner:** SM or PM
   - **Blocker for:** Documentation consistency

2. **Create Story Files for 1.4, 1.5, 1.6**
   - Extract from tech-spec-epic-1.md guidance
   - Use create-story workflow (automated)
   - Mark stories as "backlog" status (will be drafted/ready later)
   - **Time estimate:** 30 minutes √ó 3 = 90 minutes
   - **Owner:** SM
   - **Blocker for:** Full sprint tracking accuracy

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Before Story 3.2 Implementation)

3. **Create tech-spec-epic-3.md**
   - Consolidate ETL pipeline requirements (Story 3.2)
   - Define SQL query interface (Story 3.3)
   - Specify monitoring/alerting (Story 3.4)
   - Finalize Neon.tech schema details (Story 1.4 prerequisite)
   - **Time estimate:** 2 hours
   - **Owner:** Architect
   - **Blocker for:** Story 3.2 implementation confidence

---

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Next Phase)

4. **Create tech-spec-epic-4.md and epic-5.md**
   - Audiobook integration architecture (Epic 4)
   - Historical data migration strategy (Epic 5)
   - **Time estimate:** 4 hours total
   - **Owner:** Architect
   - **Blocker for:** Epic 4/5 story planning (Phase 4 later)

5. **Establish documentation maintenance protocol**
   - When to update sprint-status.yaml
   - When to update epics.md
   - When to create story files
   - Monthly sync cadence
   - **Time estimate:** 30 minutes
   - **Owner:** PM/SM
   - **Benefit:** Prevents future sync issues

## Critical Question Resolution

### Q: Is Story 1.4 Real?
**A: YES.** It exists in:
- ‚úì sprint-status.yaml (story key: 1-4-design-and-implement-unified-database-schema)
- ‚úì tech-spec-epic-1.md (explicitly covered in "Data Models and Contracts" section)
- ‚úì Being referenced by Story 3.2 as a blocker (correctly)
- ‚úó Just not in epics.md (stale reference only)

### Q: Why Isn't Story 1.4 in epics.md?
**A:** Natural planning evolution:
- epics.md was created 2025-10-27 during Phase 2 with high-level 3-story decomposition
- During Phase 4 sprint planning, work was decomposed into 6 sprint-ready stories
- epics.md wasn't updated when the sprint plan evolved (this is the gap)

### Q: Should I Follow epics.md or sprint-status.yaml?
**A:** **Follow sprint-status.yaml for execution.** Use epics.md for strategic context only.

Sprint-status.yaml is:
- Updated daily during Phase 4
- Reflects actual sprint planning decisions
- Aligned with tech-spec detailed design
- The source of truth for what's being built

### Q: Can Story 3.2 Depend on Story 1.4?
**A: YES, correctly.** Story 3.2 (ETL Pipeline) needs the Neon.tech schema designed first (Story 1.4).

This is a legitimate dependency:
- Story 1.4 outputs: Neon.tech database schema (books + reading_sessions tables)
- Story 3.2 input: Use the schema created by Story 1.4
- Resolution: Story 1.4 is in backlog; recommend prioritizing before Story 3.2 development

## How to Use This Analysis

### For Product/Scrum Master
1. Read the "Authoritative Source Hierarchy" section
2. Keep sprint-status.yaml as daily working reference
3. Update epics.md when sprint plans change (following reconciliation recommendations)
4. Reference this document when planning authority questions arise

### For Developers
1. For story context: Read docs/stories/*.md first (most detailed)
2. For design context: Reference docs/tech-spec-epic-N.md (explains WHY)
3. For scope questions: Check docs/epics.md for epic-level goals (but verify status in sprint-status.yaml)
4. For blockers: Check sprint-status.yaml (source of truth for blocking reasons)

### For Architecture/Design Discussions
1. Tech specs are the approved design baseline
2. Architecture.md documents the principles (non-negotiable)
3. Tech specs detail implementation (negotiable if architecture principles maintained)
4. When in doubt: architecture.md ‚Üí tech-spec-epic-N.md ‚Üí sprint-status.yaml (in priority order)

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Documentation quality is GOOD**
- Well-organized, standards-compliant, comprehensive
- Clear dependency chains and traceability
- Active, current tracking (daily updates)

‚ö†Ô∏è **One sync issue identified**
- epics.md out of sync with sprint-status.yaml for Epic 1 (3 vs 6 stories)
- Not a blocking issue (sprint-status.yaml is authoritative)
- Can be fixed in <2 hours

üéØ **Status quo is sustainable**
- Sprint-status.yaml working well as execution reference
- Tech specs provide design validation
- Story files growing organically with Phase 4 progress
- Archive docs useful for historical reference

üìã **Three documents need action** (see Reconciliation Plan):
1. Update epics.md Epic 1 (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. Create story files 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Create tech-spec-epic-3.md (MEDIUM PRIORITY, before Story 3.2 implementation)
