## Summary

- **Overall:** 7/11 items passed (64%)
- **Critical Issues:** 2
- **Important Gaps:** 3

---

## Validation Results

### Item 1: Overview clearly ties to PRD goals
**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:** Lines 10-12 provide clear overview connecting Epic 2 to core BookHelper goals:
> "Epic 2 extends the foundational BookHelper infrastructure (Epic 1) by enabling seamless cross-device reading and remote access. Users can sync their ebook library to a Boox Palma 2 e-reader, browse and download books on iOS via the Readest app using OPDS catalog access..."

The overview explicitly references enabling daily workflow value through cross-device reading and progress sync.

---

### Item 2: Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope
**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:** Lines 18-31 clearly delineate scope:
- **In Scope** (lines 18-23): Syncthing, OPDS, Remote Access, Progress Sync
- **Out of Scope** (lines 25-31): Android optimization, Web UI hardening, OAuth/SAML, recommendations, analytics

Well-structured with specific, actionable boundaries.

---

### Item 3: Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities
**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:** Lines 51-57 provide comprehensive Services and Modules table:
| Service | Responsibility | Technology | Integration |
Covers: Syncthing, OPDS Server, Readest App, KOSync Server, Tailscale VPN

All major components and their responsibilities clearly documented.

---

### Item 4: Data models include entities, fields, and relationships
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- Line 68 mentions "Uses existing Calibre library metadata (title, author, cover art, etc.)"
- Lines 73-74 reference "metadata" in Readest context
- No dedicated data model section defining entities, fields, and relationships

**Gap:** The spec relies on existing Calibre metadata but doesn't formally document:
- Entity schemas (Book, ReadingProgress, User, Device)
- Field definitions and constraints
- Relationships between entities
- KOSync progress sync schema structure

**Impact:** Developers must infer data structures from CWA and KOSync documentation rather than having a single source of truth in the spec.

**Recommendation:** Add a "Data Models & Schemas" section documenting:
- Book entity (inherited from Calibre)
- ReadingProgress entity (for KOSync)
- Device registry (for Tailscale/sync tracking)

---

### Item 5: APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- Line 66: OPDS endpoint specified: `http://raspberrypi.local:8083/opds`
- Lines 70-74: iOS configuration with basic auth mentioned
- Line 56: "HTTP API at `/opds` endpoint"

**Gap:** Missing:
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for each endpoint
- Request/response schemas (JSON/XML structure)
- Error handling and status codes
- Authentication schemes (basic auth details)
- KOSync API endpoints and methods
- Tailscale integration points

**Impact:** iOS developers and KOReader integrators must research CWA/KOSync docs independently to understand API contracts.

**Recommendation:** Add "API Specification" section with:
```
GET /opds
  Response: OPDS 1.2 XML catalog
  Authentication: Basic auth (if configured)
  Status: 200, 401, 500

GET /opds/categories
  Response: OPDS 1.2 categories XML
  ...

KOSync Endpoints:
POST /api/kosync/[methods]
  ...
```

---

### Item 6: NFRs: performance, security, reliability, observability addressed
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- **Performance** (lines 120-128): Targets specified for OPDS response time, sync latency, memory impact. ✓
- **Security** (lines 132-140): Risks table mentions "Readest authentication failure" and "Tailscale requires user account setup". Mentions basic auth. ⚠
- **Reliability** (lines 132-140): Risks table covers failure modes but no SLA/uptime targets. ⚠
- **Observability** (none): No logging strategy, metrics collection, or monitoring targets. ✗

**Gaps:**
- No explicit security hardening requirements (TLS, auth token rotation, rate limiting)
- No reliability targets (uptime SLA, failover strategy)
- No observability strategy (what to log, what metrics to collect, alerting rules)

**Impact:** Developers lack guidance on production-readiness criteria and may implement with insufficient security, reliability, and observability.

**Recommendation:** Add "Non-Functional Requirements" section:
```
Security:
- All remote access via Tailscale encrypted WireGuard tunnel
- OPDS basic auth for untrusted networks
- API tokens must support rotation
- Rate limiting on OPDS endpoint

Reliability:
- CWA target uptime: 99% (allows ~7 hours/month downtime)
- Syncthing recovery: auto-resume on network restore
- KOSync recovery: queue failed syncs, retry on next check-in

Observability:
- Log OPDS catalog requests (client IP, book accessed, status)
- Metrics: catalog response time, sync success rate, Tailscale connection drops
- Alerts: OPDS endpoint unreachable >1 min, Syncthing stalled >15 min
```

---

### Item 7: Dependencies/integrations enumerated with versions where known
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- Lines 99-100: Story-level dependencies documented (1.1, 2.1)
- Line 68: CWA version mentioned "v3.1.0+"
- Lines 169-173: References section lists external docs

**Gap:** Missing version pinning for:
- Readest app (iOS version requirement not specified)
- Calibre-Web-Automated exact version compatibility
- Tailscale client versions for RPi and iOS
- KOReader version for KOSync plugin
- KOSync version/branch
- Syncthing version constraints

**Impact:** Developers may use incompatible versions, leading to integration failures. Reproducibility and rollback become harder.

**Recommendation:** Add "Dependencies & Versions" section:
```
Required Components:
- Calibre-Web-Automated: v3.1.0+ (OPDS support)
- Readest iOS: v1.x (OPDS 1.2 client)
- iOS: 13+ (Readest minimum)
- RPi OS: Bullseye (current deploy)
- Syncthing: v1.23+ (one-way mode)
- Tailscale: v1.x (mesh networking)
- KOReader: v2024.x (KOSync plugin)
- KOSync: main branch (as of 2025-10-29)
```

---

### Item 8: Acceptance criteria are atomic and testable
**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:** Lines 83-90 specify AC1-AC7:
- AC1: Endpoint responds at URL ✓ (testable)
- AC2: Readest can add catalog ✓ (observable)
- AC3: Metadata displays ✓ (visual verification)
- AC4: Download works ✓ (functional test)
- AC5: Book opens in app ✓ (functional test)
- AC6: Functionality persists after restart ✓ (robustness test)
- AC7: Auth configured ✓ (functional test)

Each AC is independent, specific, and has clear pass/fail criteria. Excellent.

---

### Item 9: Traceability maps AC → Spec → Components → Tests
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- AC1-AC7 (lines 83-90) map to acceptance criteria
- Testing section (lines 76-81) maps to some ACs
- Components referenced in Services table (lines 51-57)

**Gap:** No explicit traceability matrix. Developers must manually trace:
- AC1 (endpoint responds) → which component? (OPDS Server in CWA) → test method? (HTTP GET and verify response)
- AC3 (metadata displays) → which component? (CWA catalog + Readest rendering) → test method? (visual inspection)

Missing: explicit test mapping and failure impact analysis.

**Impact:** Testing gaps may occur; difficult to verify complete coverage.

**Recommendation:** Add "Traceability Matrix" section:
```
| AC | Component | Test Method | Pass Criteria |
|----|-----------|------------|--------------|
| AC1 | OPDS Server (CWA) | HTTP GET /opds | 200 status, valid XML |
| AC2 | Readest iOS + OPDS Server | Manual add via Readest UI | Catalog lists in app |
| AC3 | CWA catalog + Readest | Inspect Readest UI | Titles, authors, covers visible |
| AC4 | Readest EPUB download | Download book in Readest | File saved locally |
| AC5 | Readest EPUB reader | Open book, navigate pages | Content readable, images render |
| AC6 | OPDS Server restart resilience | Restart CWA, test AC1 | Endpoint available, catalog intact |
| AC7 | CWA basic auth | Test with/without credentials | Catalog access restricted properly |
```

### Item 10: Risks/assumptions/questions listed with mitigation/next steps
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL

**Evidence:**
- Lines 132-140: Risks table with Severity and Mitigation columns
- Covers 5 risks: OPDS not enabled, auth failure, Syncthing conflicts, Tailscale setup, KOSync conflicts

**Gap:** Missing explicit sections for:
- **Assumptions:** e.g., "CWA OPDS is enabled by default in v3.1.0+", "Readest supports OPDS 1.2"
- **Open Questions:** e.g., "Does CWA auto-enable OPDS or require manual config?", "What if Boox storage is full?"
- **Known Issues:** No mention of version compatibility quirks or edge cases

**Impact:** Developers may overlook critical assumptions or discover blockers during implementation.

**Recommendation:** Expand to include:
```
Assumptions:
- CWA v3.1.0+ has OPDS enabled by default
- Readest app supports OPDS 1.2 catalog standard
- Basic HTTP auth sufficient for LAN security
- RPi network remains stable (no loss >15 min)

Open Questions:
1. Does CWA require explicit admin panel toggle to enable OPDS?
2. What OPDS catalog response time if library >1000 books?
3. Does Readest support resume on same device after app update?
4. Boox storage full - does Syncthing pause gracefully?

Known Issues:
- CWA OPDS does not support cover art resizing; may cause slow load on slow networks
```

---

### Item 11: Test strategy covers all ACs and critical paths
**Status:** ✓ PASS

**Evidence:** Lines 76-81 specify testing for Story 2.2:
- Browse library catalog in Readest (tests AC2, AC3)
- Download test book (tests AC4)
- Open book and verify readable (tests AC5)
- Verify cover art displays (tests AC3)
- Verify metadata matches (tests AC3)
- Restart CWA and verify catalog remains functional (tests AC6)

Implicit: auth configuration testing (tests AC7)

All ACs have corresponding test steps. Critical path (catalog → download → read) explicitly covered.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Dev)

### Issue 1: Missing API Specification (Item 5)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Why:** Developers need formal API contracts to integrate with Readest and KOSync. Without schemas, integration testing will be ad-hoc and error-prone.

**Recommended Action:** Add "API Specification" section before marking story ready.

---

### Issue 2: No Observability/Reliability Targets (Item 6)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Why:** Production readiness is undefined. Developers may ship without monitoring or SLA guarantees, leading to silent failures in the field.

**Recommended Action:** Add "NFR: Reliability & Observability" subsection defining monitoring, alerting, and uptime targets.

---

## Important Gaps (Should Improve)

### Gap 1: Incomplete Data Models (Item 4)
**Action:** Add formal data schema for ReadingProgress and Device tracking before Epic 2 is complete.

### Gap 2: Version Constraints Missing (Item 7)
**Action:** Pin all dependency versions before marking stories ready for test.

### Gap 3: Traceability Matrix Not Explicit (Item 9)
**Action:** Add traceability table before QA sign-off.

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Blocking Dev)
1. **Add API Specification:** Document OPDS endpoints, KOSync endpoints, request/response schemas, auth requirements
2. **Add Reliability & Observability NFRs:** Define monitoring, logging, alerting, uptime targets

### Should Do (Before Test)
3. **Add Data Model Section:** Define Book, ReadingProgress, Device entities and relationships
4. **Pin Dependency Versions:** Specify exact version ranges for all tools (CWA, Readest, Tailscale, KOSync, etc.)
5. **Add Assumptions & Open Questions:** Document assumptions and unknowns discovered during review

### Consider (Nice to Have)
6. **Add Traceability Matrix:** Map ACs → Components → Tests for completeness
7. **Add Known Issues:** Document version quirks and edge cases

---

## Next Steps

**Status:** **BLOCKED - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

Before proceeding to Story 2.2 development:

1. **Resolve Critical Issues:**
   - Add API specification with methods and schemas
   - Add NFR section (Reliability & Observability)

2. **Address Important Gaps:**
   - Document data models
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Re-validate:** Run this validation again after updates

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours to resolve critical issues + 1 hour for re-validation
