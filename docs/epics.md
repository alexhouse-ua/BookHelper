# BookHelper - Epic Breakdown

**Author:** Alex
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Project Level:** 2
**Target Scale:** Medium project - 5 epics, 12-14 stories total (revised from 21 to align with realistic execution patterns)

---

## Overview

This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for BookHelper, expanding on the high-level epic list in the [PRD](./PRD.md).

Each epic includes:
- Expanded goal and value proposition
- Complete story breakdown with user stories
- Acceptance criteria for each story
- Story sequencing and dependencies

**Epic Sequencing Principles:**
- Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and database schema
- Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
- Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
- No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work

---

## Epic 1: Core Library Server & Database Foundation

**Expanded Goal:**
Establish the foundational infrastructure for BookHelper by deploying a self-hosted library server on Raspberry Pi 4 with automated ebook ingestion and metadata enrichment. Create the unified database schema that will support analytics and historical data migration in later epics. This epic delivers immediate value by enabling zero-touch library management with automatic metadata lookups.

**How it builds on previous work:**
This is the foundation epic - no dependencies on other work. All subsequent epics depend on this infrastructure being operational.

## Epic 3: Ebook Statistics Backup & Analytics

**Expanded Goal:**
Protect valuable ebook reading data from device failure by implementing automated one-way backup of KOReader statistics to cloud storage. Create an ETL pipeline that extracts reading sessions from the SQLite database and loads them into the unified Neon.tech PostgreSQL analytics database. Enable SQL-based querying of reading statistics and implement monitoring/alerting to detect backup or sync failures. This epic ensures data safety before attempting risky historical migration operations.

**How it builds on previous work:**
Depends on Epic 1 (unified database schema exists) and Epic 2 (Syncthing already configured for library sync). Builds upon existing infrastructure by adding statistics-specific backup and analytics capabilities.

---

**Story 3.1: Configure one-way statistics backup from Boox to RPi**

As a reader,
I want my KOReader statistics automatically backed up to my Raspberry Pi,
So that I don't lose my reading history if my Boox device fails or the database becomes corrupted.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. New Syncthing folder configured for KOReader statistics directory on Boox
2. Syncthing configured as "Send Only" from Boox (device is source of truth)

4. Statistics.sqlite3 backed up to RPi within 5 minutes of reading session end
5. File versioning enabled on RPi to maintain 30-day backup history
6. Test: Read on Boox, verify statistics.sqlite3 backed up successfully to RPi
7. Validation: Confirm RPi never writes to Boox statistics folder (corruption prevention)
8. Documentation: Clearly mark this backup as disaster recovery only (NOT for progress sync - that's KOSync)

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.1 complete (Syncthing already configured between devices)

---

**Story 3.2: Build ETL pipeline for statistics extraction**

As a developer,
I want reading session data automatically extracted from statistics.sqlite3 and loaded into Neon.tech,
So that I can query unified analytics across all reading sources.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

---

## Epic 4: Audiobook Integration

**Expanded Goal:**
Extend the unified reading timeline to include audiobook listening data by integrating BookPlayer with the analytics database. Configure Hardcover.app sync for audiobooks to maintain a complete reading timeline across both ebooks and audiobooks. Extend the Neon.tech database schema to accommodate audiobook-specific fields while maintaining unified queries across media types.

**How it builds on previous work:**
Depends on Epic 1 (database schema foundation exists) and Epic 3 (ETL pipeline and analytics infrastructure operational). Audiobook data is independent of ebook infrastructure, making this epic deferrable without blocking core ebook functionality.

---

**Story 4.1: Set up BookPlayer and configure Hardcover sync**

7. Script logs created showing successful API calls and record counts

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.1 complete (audiobook data exists in Hardcover)

---

**Story 4.3: Integrate audiobook data into unified database**

As a developer,

## Epic 5: Historical Data Migration & Timeline Consolidation

**Expanded Goal:**
Migrate years of historical reading data from proprietary Amazon ecosystems (Kindle and Audible) into the unified BookHelper database, creating a complete reading timeline spanning all sources. This is the riskiest epic due to potential data corruption, so it includes sandbox testing, validation checkpoints, and rollback mechanisms. By reconciling imported data against Hardcover.app as the source of truth, this epic ensures data integrity while backfilling the complete reading history into the analytics database.

**How it builds on previous work:**
Depends critically on Epic 3 - requires operational backup system and ETL pipeline before attempting risky data migration. Also depends on Epic 1 (database schema) and benefits from Epic 4 (Hardcover API integration). This epic is intentionally sequenced last to ensure stable infrastructure exists before manipulating historical data.

**DEPENDENCY GATE:** Cannot start until Story 3.1 (statistics backup) and Story 3.4 (monitoring/alerting) are complete and validated. Must have verified backup and rollback capability before touching production statistics database.

---

**Story 5.1: Set up sandbox testing environment for migration**

As a developer,

5. Documentation created explaining sandbox workflow: develop â†’ test â†’ validate â†’ apply to production
6. Rollback procedure documented: restore from backup if production migration fails
7. Test: Intentionally corrupt sandbox database, verify it can be detected and restored from backup

**Prerequisites:** Story 3.1 complete (backup system operational to provide restore capability)

---

**Story 5.2: Build Kindle reading history parser and import script**

2. Python script created to parse Kindle export format (CSV, JSON, or HTML depending on export type)
3. Script extracts: book title, author, reading dates, progress/completion status, page numbers (if available)
4. Script transforms Kindle data to KOReader statistics.sqlite3 schema format
5. Script handles ISBN/ASIN matching to link Kindle books with Calibre library entries
6. Test: Run import on sandbox database, verify Kindle entries appear correctly
7. Test: Validate sandbox database still opens in KOReader without errors

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1 complete (testing environment established), Story 4.3 complete (audiobook schema exists in Neon.tech)

---

**Story 5.4: Implement data validation and rollback mechanism**

As a developer,
I want automated validation to verify migration success and rollback capability if validation fails,
So that I can confidently import historical data without risking database corruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Pre-migration backup script created: snapshots statistics.sqlite3 with timestamp before import
2. Validation script created with checks:
   - Database opens successfully in sqlite3 (no corruption)
   - KOReader schema integrity validated (correct tables and columns)
   - No duplicate book entries introduced
   - Timestamp ranges are valid (no future dates)
   - Foreign key constraints maintained
3. Post-migration validation runs automatically after import completes

   - Books in imports but missing from Hardcover (potential duplicates or unlisted books)
   - Date conflicts where Hardcover and import timestamps differ
4. Reconciliation script allows manual conflict resolution via config file
5. Final unified timeline created in Neon.tech combining:
   - Historical Kindle data (from Story 5.2)
   - Historical Audible data (from Story 5.3)
   - Current KOReader data (from Story 3.2 ETL pipeline)
   - Current BookPlayer data (from Story 4.3)
6. Test query: "Show complete reading timeline 2020-2024" returns merged results from all sources
7. Test query: "Books read per year" accurately counts across all data sources
8. Documentation created: data lineage showing source of each reading record
