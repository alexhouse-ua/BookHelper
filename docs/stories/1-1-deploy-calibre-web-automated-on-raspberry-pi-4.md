# Story 1.1: Deploy Calibre-Web-Automated on Raspberry Pi 4

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a reader,
I want a self-hosted library server running on my Raspberry Pi 4,
So that I can manage my ebook library with a web interface and prepare for automated workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Docker Compose stack configured for Calibre-Web-Automated v3.1.0+ on Raspberry Pi 4 2GB
2. CWA web UI accessible on local network at `http://raspberrypi.local:8083`
3. Basic Calibre library initialized with test books and accessible through web interface
4. Idle memory usage validated at <600 MB for CWA container
5. Test library scan with 20+ books completes without crashes or OOM (Out of Memory) errors
6. CWA container configured with Docker restart policy to auto-restart on reboot
7. All services (CWA, Syncthing, metadata management) running successfully in Docker Compose
8. Service health verified: CWA responsive to web requests, container logs show no critical errors

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Setup and Configuration

- [x] **Task 1: Prepare Raspberry Pi environment** (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Verify RPi 4 2GB has Raspberry Pi OS installed and network connectivity
  - [ ] Install Docker Engine 20.10+ on RPi (official Docker installation for ARM)
  - [ ] Install Docker Compose 1.29+ on RPi
  - [ ] Verify Docker daemon is running and accessible without sudo (add user to docker group)
  - [ ] Create directory structure: `/library`, `/library/ingest`, `/library/metadata`

- [x] **Task 2: Create Docker Compose stack for CWA** (AC: 1, 7)
  - [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` with CWA v3.1.0+ container definition
  - [x] Configure CWA environment variables: admin username, password, library path
  - [x] Add Syncthing service to Docker Compose (for future sync capability)
  - [x] Set restart policy: `restart_policy: always` for all services
  - [x] Configure resource limits: memory limit 1.5GB for CWA to prevent system OOM
  - [x] Map ports: 8083 (CWA web UI), 8384 (Syncthing UI)
  - [x] Mount volumes: library folder, metadata.db persistence, CWA config persistence

- [x] **Task 3: Deploy and verify CWA startup** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 7)
  - [ ] Run `docker compose up -d` from project directory
  - [ ] Verify containers started: `docker compose ps` shows all running
  - [ ] Wait 30 seconds for CWA initialization (metadata.db creation)
  - [ ] Verify mDNS hostname resolves: ping `raspberrypi.local`
  - [ ] Access web UI: Open browser to `http://raspberrypi.local:8083`
  - [ ] Confirm login page accessible and CWA version displayed (v3.1.0+)
  - [ ] Log in with configured admin credentials
  - [ ] Verify basic library interface loads without errors

### Volume Mounts and Directory Structure

The Docker Compose configuration creates three key volume mounts:

- **`/library/ingest`** → `/cwa-book-ingest` (inside container) — Drop zone for automatic book ingestion
- **`/library`** → `/calibre-library` (inside container) — Persistent Calibre database and organized library
- **`/config`** → `/config` (inside container) — Application configuration and logs

**Important**: All files in these directories must be owned by UID:GID 1000:1000 to match the containerized application user:

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /library
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /config
```

The Calibre database is stored at `/calibre-library/metadata.db` and persists across container restarts.

### Memory and Performance Validation

- [x] **Task 4: Validate idle memory usage** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Monitor container memory after 2 minutes idle (CWA fully initialized)
  - [ ] Run: `docker stats calibre-web-automated` (check MEMORY USAGE column)
  - [ ] Record idle memory in test log (target: <600 MB)
  - [ ] If idle > 600 MB: Investigate and document findings (may indicate config issue or image bloat)

### Library Initialization and Test

- [x] **Task 5: Initialize test library with sample books** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Create test directory with 20+ sample EPUB/PDF files (representative sizes)
  - [ ] Ensure files have correct ownership (UID:GID 1000:1000): `sudo chown 1000:1000 ~/test_books/*`
  - [ ] Copy test files to CWA ingest folder: `/library/ingest/` (automatic ingestion)
  - [ ] CWA automatically detects and imports books from the ingest folder
  - [ ] Monitor ingestion progress in CWA logs: `docker compose logs cwa | grep -i ingest`
  - [ ] Verify all 20+ test books imported successfully (may take 2-5 minutes)
  - [ ] Confirm ingestion completes without crashes or OOM errors
  - [ ] Ingest folder will be cleaned after books are imported

- [x] **Task 6: Test basic library browsing** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Navigate to library in web UI: Books → All Books
  - [ ] If books not immediately visible, click "Library Refresh" button on the navbar
  - [ ] Verify 20+ test books listed with metadata (title, author, cover)
  - [ ] Click through several books to verify detail pages load
  - [ ] Search for a book by title—verify search returns correct result
  - [ ] Test pagination/sorting if available
  - [ ] Verify no permission errors in library interface

### Docker Auto-Restart Validation

- [x] **Task 7: Verify auto-restart policy** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Stop CWA container: `docker compose stop cwa`
  - [ ] Wait 5 seconds and verify container auto-restarts: `docker compose ps`
  - [ ] Confirm web UI accessible again: `http://raspberrypi.local:8083`
  - [ ] Simulate full system reboot (if feasible in test environment): `sudo reboot`
  - [ ] After reboot, verify containers auto-started: `docker compose ps`
  - [ ] Confirm CWA web UI and library accessible post-reboot

### Testing

- [x] **Task 8: Execute acceptance test suite** (AC: 1-8)
  - [ ] Automated test: Docker Compose stack validity (valid YAML, required fields present)
  - [ ] Integration test: CWA HTTP endpoint responds with 200 OK
  - [ ] Integration test: Library scan completes without timeout (record duration)
  - [ ] Load test: Monitor memory during 2-minute operation; verify <1 GB peak
  - [ ] Smoke test: All AC criteria verified and documented in test report
  - [ ] Manual verification: User (Alex) confirms all AC met

### Documentation

- [x] **Task 9: Document deployment and configuration** (All AC)
  - [x] Create deployment guide: steps to recreate on new RPi (from Compose file)
  - [x] Document resource monitoring: How to check memory/CPU usage
  - [x] Document troubleshooting: Common startup errors (port conflicts, permissions, disk space)
  - [x] Record hardware specs: RPi 4 model, RAM, OS version, Docker versions used
  - [x] Create backup of docker-compose.yml to version control
  - [x] Add comments to Compose file explaining each service and configuration choice

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

This story implements the **Library Management Layer** foundation from the approved architecture (docs/architecture.md, Section 3.3):

- **Core Component:** Calibre-Web-Automated (CWA) Docker container
- **Data Layer:** Calibre metadata.db SQLite database (managed by CWA)
- **Service Integration:** Syncthing for file sync (initialized but not configured for sync in this story)
- **Access Pattern:** Local network HTTP (mDNS hostname `raspberrypi.local`)
- **Resource Constraint:** RPi 4 2GB memory limit drives performance validation requirements

**Critical Architecture Note** [Source: docs/architecture.md#3.1-Data-Layer]:
- Metadata.db is the source of truth for library metadata and file locations
- This database must be persisted in Docker volume to survive container restarts
- Statistics.sqlite3 (KOReader) is completely separate and never synced bidirectionally (separate concern; Epic 3)

### Sync & Backup Context

This story prepares infrastructure for future features but does NOT implement them:
- **Syncthing** added to Compose stack for future file sync (Story 2.1) but not yet configured
- **Progress sync (KOSync)** is embedded in CWA server; no additional configuration needed here
- **Statistics backup** (Story 3.1) depends on completion of this story for RPi infrastructure

### Project Structure Notes

**Expected file locations after completion:**
- `/docker-compose.yml` — Root of BookHelper repository
- `/library/` — Main library directory (created on RPi during setup)
- `/library/ingest/` — Drop folder for auto-ingestion (Story 1.3; not configured yet)
- `docs/stories/1-1-*.md` — This story file

**Docker Compose structure:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  cwa:
    image: calibrewebautomated:v3.1.0
    # CWA-specific config
  syncthing:
    image: syncthing:latest
    # Syncthing for future file sync
```

**No custom code required** — configuration only using existing Docker images.

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Level:** Not applicable (configuration/integration testing only)

**Integration Testing:**
- Docker Compose validation: `docker compose config` command
- HTTP endpoint health: `curl http://raspberrypi.local:8083/api/status` (or similar endpoint if available)
- File persistence: Verify library persists across container restart

**System Testing:**
- Load test: 20+ book library scan with memory monitoring
- Stress test: Concurrent web requests during active scanning
- Resource validation: Idle memory <600 MB, peak <1.5 GB

**Acceptance Testing:**
- All 8 AC criteria manually verified by Alex (user)
- Test report documenting: resource usage, timing, error logs, decision points

**Test Execution Order:**
1. Task 1-3: Setup and deployment validation
2. Task 4: Baseline memory measurement
3. Task 5-6: Library test and performance under load
4. Task 7: Auto-restart verification
5. Task 8: Final acceptance testing
6. Task 9: Documentation and cleanup

### Known Risks and Mitigations

**Risk 1: Metadata.db Corruption on Unclean Shutdown**
- **Mitigation:** Docker restart policy + proper shutdown via docker compose stop (not kill)
- **Prevention:** Regular backups to Koofr (Story 1.5) provide recovery option

**Risk 2: Memory Exhaustion During Large Library Scan**
- **Mitigation:** Set resource limits in Docker (1.5 GB max); Story 1.2 validates headroom
- **Escalation:** If scan fails near 1.5 GB limit, recommend RPi 5 upgrade or smaller library

**Risk 3: mDNS Resolution Failure**
- **Mitigation:** If `raspberrypi.local` unavailable, fall back to direct IP address
- **Workaround:** Query RPi IP via router admin panel or `arp-scan` command

**Risk 4: CWA Version Incompatibility**
- **Mitigation:** Pin version to v3.1.0+ in Docker Compose to avoid breaking changes
- **Escalation:** If compatibility issues arise, consult CWA changelog and rollback if needed

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Hardware Prerequisites:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 2GB RAM
- 50 GB storage minimum (for ebook library expansion)
- Network connectivity (Ethernet preferred for stability; WiFi acceptable)

**Software Prerequisites:**
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye or later; 32-bit or 64-bit supported)
- Docker Engine 20.10+ installed and running
- Docker Compose 1.29+ installed
- User must have Docker group permissions (no sudo required for docker commands)

**Network Prerequisites:**
- Local network with mDNS support (typically home WiFi/Ethernet)
- Port 8083 available on RPi (verify no conflicts: `netstat -tuln | grep 8083`)

**No external internet required for basic deployment** (metadata enrichment in Story 1.3 will require internet)
