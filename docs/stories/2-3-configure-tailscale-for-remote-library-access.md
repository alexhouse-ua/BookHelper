## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Reference:** [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#Story-2.3-Remote-Access-via-Tailscale]

Story 2.3 implements the **Remote Access Layer** of BookHelper architecture using Tailscale mesh VPN. Unlike Story 2.2 (OPDS endpoint on local network), this story enables off-network access to both the CWA web UI and OPDS catalog from iOS and Boox devices using encrypted, peer-to-peer connections.

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- **Tailscale Mesh VPN:** Peer-to-peer VPN without exposing RPi to public internet; each device gets 100.x.x.x private IP
- **Encrypted Transit:** All traffic encrypted by WireGuard protocol; no additional TLS layer needed for OPDS
- **Zero-Trust Model:** Tailscale provides device authentication and network access control
- **Dependency on Story 2.2:** Builds directly on OPDS endpoint (same HTTP endpoint, accessible via Tailscale IP instead of local hostname)

**Security Model:**
- Tailscale network is private mesh (authenticated devices only)
- CWA basic auth still required for web UI login (defense in depth)
- No firewall port forwarding needed (P2P connections)
- All Tailscale peers have explicit IPs in 100.0.0.0/8 range (not exposed to internet)

### Services and Components

| Component | Responsibility | Technology | Integration |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **Tailscale Daemon (RPi)** | VPN mesh connectivity on RPi | Tailscale Linux client | WireGuard tunnels |
| **Tailscale iOS App** | VPN mesh connectivity on iPhone | Tailscale iOS app | Always-on VPN |
| **Tailscale Boox/Android** | VPN mesh connectivity on Boox | Tailscale Android or alternative | System VPN |
| **CWA OPDS Module** | Same OPDS endpoint as Story 2.2 | CWA built-in | Accessible via `http://100.x.x.x:8083/opds` |
| **CWA Web UI** | Admin and library management | CWA web interface | Accessible via `http://100.x.x.x:8083` |

### Project Structure Notes

**No new files to create** - Tailscale is external VPN service; configuration is on third-party services and device apps, not in repo.

**Files to reference (configuration context only):**
- `/docker-compose.yml` - CWA configuration (unchanged)
- Tailscale documentation for platform-specific setup

**Future integrations:**
- Story 2.4 (KOSync) will also be accessible via Tailscale IPs
- Monitoring (Story 3.x) may track Tailscale connection status

### Dependencies

**Must Have:**
- Story 2.2 complete: OPDS endpoint working on local network
- Story 2.1 complete: Syncthing configured (context for device setup)
- Active Tailscale account (free tier sufficient)
- All three devices (RPi, iOS, Boox) able to connect to Tailscale network

**Recommended Context:**
- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#Remote-Access-Layer]
- Tailscale admin console: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines

### API Specification

**OPDS via Tailscale:**
```
GET http://100.x.x.x:8083/opds
(Same endpoint as Story 2.2, but accessed via Tailscale IP instead of local hostname)
Authentication: Basic auth (if CWA requires login)
Response: OPDS 1.2 Atom XML (identical to local access)
Performance Target: <2 seconds (same as local, encrypted tunnel overhead ~5-10%)
```

**CWA Web UI via Tailscale:**
```
GET http://100.x.x.x:8083/
HTTP/HTTPS (HTTP via Tailscale tunnel is already encrypted)
Authentication: CWA admin credentials
Response: HTML web interface
```

### Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Tailscale account not active/expired | Medium | Ensure Tailscale subscription active; use free tier if cost constraint |
| Device VPN not auto-starting | Medium | Verify systemd service on RPi, Always-on VPN setting on iOS, Boox startup scripts |
| Firewall blocks Tailscale traffic | Low | Tailscale uses UDP port 41641; may need firewall rule on home network (check ISP router) |
| Slowdown on cellular vs. WiFi | Low | Expected behavior; test to confirm acceptable download speeds |
| IP changes on Tailscale reconnect | Low | Tailscale IPs are stable for authenticated devices; unlikely to change mid-session |

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Targets:**
- CWA web UI load time from iOS: <3 seconds (vs. <1s on local WiFi)
- OPDS catalog response: <2 seconds (encrypted tunnel overhead acceptable)
- Book download speed: Depends on cellular network (test to confirm >50 KB/s typical)
- VPN connection establishment: <10 seconds on app launch

**Reliability:**
- Tailscale connection stability: Should maintain connection for entire session
- Auto-reconnection: Should re-establish if connection drops
- Device roaming: Should handle switching between WiFi and cellular without dropping

**Security:**
- All traffic encrypted via WireGuard (Tailscale default)
- No exposure to public internet (mesh VPN only)
- Device authentication required (Tailscale account)
- CWA basic auth provides second factor

[Full spec: Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#Non-Functional-Requirements]

### Lessons from Previous Story (Story 2.2)

**From Story 2.2 Completion Notes:**
- OPDS endpoint is robust and performant (0.25s response time)
- CWA's built-in features eliminate need for custom code
- Configuration-only stories are lower risk and fast to validate
- Basic auth works reliably as CWA's authentication mechanism
- No additional Docker configuration needed

**Application to Story 2.3:**
- Story 2.3 is also configuration-only (Tailscale, not custom code)
- Will reuse CWA's built-in endpoints (OPDS, web UI) - no code changes
- Similar risk profile: service configuration + device setup + testing
- May encounter platform-specific Tailscale variations (Android vs iOS), but core pattern same

   - This endpoint is available and functional
   - **Future:** When Readest OPDS support becomes active, this endpoint can be configured in Readest app

**Checkpoint:** CWA web UI accessible and functional remotely via Tailscale; book downloads work over cellular. Proceed to Task 7.

---

### TASK 7: Configure Firewall Rules and Security

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **On Raspberry Pi, check firewall status:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```
   - If "command not found" → UFW not installed (default on many RPi systems)
   - If "Status: inactive" → firewall is off, no action needed
   - If "Status: active" → proceed to step 2

2. **If UFW is not installed (no firewall manager):**
   - This is the default state for most Raspberry Pi OS installations
   - Tailscale operates at the application level and doesn't require UFW rules
   - Continue to step 4
   - **Record:** Firewall status = `UFW not installed (no firewall manager active)`

3. **If firewall IS active, verify Tailscale rules:**
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```
   - Look for rules allowing port 8083 or Tailscale interface
   - Tailscale typically handles its own firewall rules automatically
   - If needed, add explicit rule:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0 to any port 8083
     sudo ufw reload
     ```

4. **Verify Tailscale traffic is encrypted:**
   - This is automatic with Tailscale (WireGuard encryption)
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Document: "All traffic encrypted via WireGuard (Tailscale default)"

5. **Test that CWA is accessible via Tailscale:**
   - From iOS (on Tailscale, cellular network), verify you can access CWA
   - Navigate to: `http://100.103.222.63:8083`
   - Should load CWA login page and allow downloads
   - **Record:** Tailscale access test = `_______` (pass/fail)

6. **Test that external (non-Tailscale) IPs cannot access CWA:**
   - From iOS, **disable Tailscale** (disconnect VPN)
   - Ensure you're on cellular network (not home WiFi)
   - Try to access: `http://raspberrypi.local:8083` or your RPi's public IP (if any)
   - **Expected result:** Connection should fail or time out
   - This confirms CWA is not exposed to public internet
   - **Record:** External access test = `_______` (should be "blocked/failed" or "timeout")

7. **Document firewall configuration:**
   - Firewall status = `UFW not installed; Tailscale handles VPN encryption natively`
   - Tailscale security = `WireGuard encryption + device authentication (Tailscale mesh)`
   - External access blocking = `Verified` (confirmed cannot access from non-Tailscale IP)

### Completion Notes

**Story 2.3 Implementation Complete (2025-10-29)**

**Summary:**
Successfully configured Tailscale mesh VPN for remote library access across three devices (RPi, iOS, Boox Palma 2). All 8 acceptance criteria verified and tested.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1. **Tailscale Installation & Configuration:**
   - RPi: Installed via official script, configured with auto-start on boot
   - iOS: Installed from App Store, configured for manual activation (battery conservation)
   - Boox Palma 2: Installed, configured for manual activation (battery conservation)

2. **Network Setup:**
   - All three devices successfully joined Tailscale mesh network
   - Mesh connectivity verified: all devices can reach each other via 100.x.x.x IPs
   - RPi Tailscale IP: `100.103.222.63`
   - iOS Tailscale IP: `100.77.42.77`
   - Boox Tailscale IP: `100.98.62.94`

3. **Remote Access Verification:**
   - CWA web UI successfully accessible via Tailscale on cellular network
   - Book downloads verified on cellular via CWA web UI
   - OPDS endpoint (`http://100.103.222.63:8083/opds`) confirmed functional, available for future Readest integration
   - All traffic encrypted via WireGuard (automatic, no additional configuration needed)

4. **Security & Firewall:**
   - UFW not installed on RPi (default state for Raspberry Pi OS) - no additional firewall configuration required
   - Tailscale handles VPN encryption and authentication natively
   - CWA not exposed to external internet - only accessible via authenticated Tailscale connection

5. **Battery Optimization:**
   - iOS and Boox configured for manual VPN activation (not always-on)
   - Users manually toggle VPN on when accessing library, toggle off when done
   - Significant battery conservation vs. always-on configuration

6. **Documentation:**
   - Comprehensive execution guide created with all actual IP addresses
   - Quick reference guide documented: "How to Access Library Remotely"
   - All tasks marked complete with verified testing

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ All 9 tasks completed and validated
- ✅ All 8 acceptance criteria verified
- ✅ Remote access works reliably on cellular network
- ✅ Book downloads stable and functional
- ✅ No external IP access confirmed
- ✅ Device mesh connectivity confirmed
- ✅ Tailscale auto-start on RPi verified post-reboot

**Readiness Note:**
Readest OPDS support is currently in development and not yet active. CWA web UI remains the primary method for accessing library remotely. OPDS endpoint documented for future Readest integration when their OPDS client support launches.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Readest OPDS integration when available (endpoint pre-configured and ready)
- Potential smart VPN activation on app launch (if Tailscale adds this feature)

### File List

**Files Modified:** None
**Files Created:** None (Tailscale is external service; configuration only)

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Story ID:** 2.3
**Epic:** 2 - Device Sync & Remote Access
**Developer Notes:** Story 2.3 continues the configuration-only pattern from Story 2.2. Primary focus is Tailscale mesh VPN setup across three devices (RPi, iOS, Boox) with validation that OPDS and CWA web UI remain accessible remotely. Lower development risk than feature implementation; success criteria are clear and testable.
