# Story 3.1: Configure one-way statistics backup from Boox to RPi

Status: review

## Story

As a reader,
I want my KOReader statistics automatically backed up to my Raspberry Pi,
So that I don't lose my reading history if my Boox device fails or the database becomes corrupted.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ New Syncthing folder configured for KOReader statistics directory on Boox
2. ✅ Syncthing configured as "Send Only" from Boox (device is source of truth)
3. ✅ Syncthing configured as "Receive Only" on RPi (server never writes back)
4. ✅ Statistics.sqlite3 backed up to RPi within 5 minutes of reading session end (verified <1 minute)
5. ✅ File versioning enabled on RPi to maintain 30-day backup history (Staggered, maxAge=30)
6. ✅ Test: Read on Boox, verify statistics.sqlite3 backed up successfully to RPi (confirmed)
7. ✅ Validation: Confirm RPi never writes to Boox statistics folder (corruption prevention verified)
8. ✅ Documentation: Clearly mark this backup as disaster recovery only (docs/STATISTICS-BACKUP-SETUP.md)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Prepare Boox device for statistics backup (AC 1)
  - [x] On Boox, locate KOReader statistics directory (typically `/storage/emulated/0/koreader/` or `/sdcard/koreader/`)
  - [x] Confirm `statistics.sqlite3` file exists
  - [x] Verify file size and modification timestamp
  - [x] Document exact path for Syncthing configuration

- [x] Task 2: Configure Syncthing "Send Only" folder on Boox (AC 1-2)
  - [x] Open Syncthing app on Boox
  - [x] Create new folder for statistics backup
  - [x] Set folder path to KOReader statistics directory
  - [x] Configure as "Send Only" (device sends updates, receives none)
  - [x] Add RPi as the destination device
  - [x] Note the folder ID (e.g., "koreader-statistics")

- [x] Task 3: Configure Syncthing "Receive Only" folder on RPi (AC 3)
  - [x] SSH into RPi: `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`
  - [x] Verify Syncthing service is running: `docker ps | grep syncthing`
  - [x] Add the same folder as "Receive Only" on RPi
  - [x] Set destination path (e.g., `/home/pi/backups/koreader-statistics/`)
  - [x] Create directory if doesn't exist: `mkdir -p /home/pi/backups/koreader-statistics/`
  - [x] Confirm folder pair established (both devices show "Idle" status)

- [x] Task 4: Enable file versioning for 30-day retention (AC 5)
  - [x] In Syncthing folder settings on RPi, enable "File Versioning"
  - [x] Select versioning type: "Staggered File Versioning" (intelligent retention)
  - [x] Configure retention: maxAge = 30 days
  - [x] Test versioning by deleting a file from backup and verifying recovery

- [x] Task 5: Validate one-way sync and corruption prevention (AC 4, 7)
  - [x] On Boox, open a book in KOReader and read a few pages
  - [x] Close the book completely
  - [x] Wait 5 minutes for Syncthing sync
  - [x] Verify on RPi: `ls -la /home/alexhouse/backups/koreader-statistics/` shows updated `statistics.sqlite3`
  - [x] Check modification timestamp: `stat /home/alexhouse/backups/koreader-statistics/statistics.sqlite3`
  - [x] Verify one-way restriction: Syncthing shows "Receive Only" on RPi (no uploads from RPi to Boox)
  - [x] Confirmed: RPi cannot modify statistics.sqlite3 on Boox

- [x] Task 6: Test realistic sync latency (AC 4)
  - [x] Verified: Statistics.sqlite3 syncs within <1 minute of reading session end
  - [x] AC 4 requirement: Backup within 5 minutes ✓ (observed <1 minute)
  - [x] Syncthing logs confirm no missed syncs or delays
  - [x] Ongoing monitoring: Natural reading sessions will continue to validate latency

- [x] Task 7: Create documentation (AC 8)
  - [x] Create file: `docs/STATISTICS-BACKUP-SETUP.md`
  - [x] Document purpose: "Statistics backup is for disaster recovery ONLY, not for progress sync"
  - [x] Document Boox folder configuration (Send Only)
  - [x] Document RPi folder configuration (Receive Only)
  - [x] Document versioning retention policy (30 days with Staggered File Versioning)
  - [x] Document troubleshooting steps (sync status checks, log verification)
  - [x] Add warning: "Do NOT use this folder for progress sync - use KOSync instead"

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

This story implements the **Disaster Recovery Backup** layer from the system architecture [Source: docs/architecture.md § 3.2. Sync & Backup Layer]:

- **One-way sync pattern:** Boox is "Send Only", RPi is "Receive Only" - prevents corruption of the source database on the device
- **Separate from progress sync:** This backup is distinct from KOSync (Story 2.4), which handles live progress synchronization using application-aware protocols
- **Critical safety constraint:** [Source: docs/architecture.md § 4. Critical Warnings - SQLite Corruption Risk]
  - File-level sync of a live SQLite database can cause "torn writes" and irreversible corruption
  - The one-way sync pattern ensures the device never receives back a corrupted version
  - Progress sync MUST use application-aware tools (KOSync), not file-level sync

### Project Structure Notes

- Syncthing is already installed and configured on both Boox and RPi (from Story 2.1)
- RPi backup directory structure: `/home/pi/backups/koreader-statistics/`
- KOReader statistics directory on Boox: `/storage/emulated/0/koreader/` (verify exact path)
- Documentation location: `docs/STATISTICS-BACKUP-SETUP.md` (new file)

### Technical Implementation Notes

- **Folder ID:** Choose a descriptive ID (e.g., "koreader-statistics") for identification in logs
- **Versioning:** Simple File Versioning on RPi keeps prior versions for 30 days, enabling recovery from accidental deletion
- **Latency requirement:** AC 4 specifies 5 minutes; typical Syncthing sync is <1 minute on LAN
- **Logging:** Check Syncthing logs for sync completion: Both devices should show "Idle" when sync complete

### Learnings from Previous Story (Story 2.4)

**From Story 2.4 (Status: done)**

Story 2.4 (KOSync progress sync) completed the cross-device reading experience by syncing progress between Boox and iOS. Key learnings that apply to Story 3.1:

- **Syncthing is a tool for file sync, NOT progress sync:** Story 2.4 implemented KOSync (application-aware) for progress. This story uses Syncthing (file-level) for backup only.
- **Separation of concerns is critical:** Story 2.4 syncs progress via KOSync; Story 3.1 backs up the database file via Syncthing one-way. These must not be mixed.
- **File versioning enables recovery:** Story 2.4 noted that backups with versioning are essential for disaster recovery.
- **Hardcover plugin on KOReader handles progress to Hardcover:** Story 2.4 verified that KOReader's Hardcover plugin provides reliable progress sync without needing to sync the database file.
