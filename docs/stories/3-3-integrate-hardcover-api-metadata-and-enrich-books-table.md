# Story 3.3: Integrate Hardcover API metadata and enrich books table

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want to enrich the books dimension table with Hardcover API metadata,
So that reading analytics include complete book information (author, publisher, cover, rating).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hardcover API authentication and connection validation
2. Personal library query and book extraction from Hardcover
3. Metadata transformation to Neon.tech books schema
4. ISBN-based matching between Hardcover and existing books
5. Data enrichment: Update books table with Hardcover metadata (author_id, publisher_id, rating, cover_url)
6. Fallback matching: Title+author matching when ISBN unavailable
7. Data source tracking: Record which books came from Hardcover vs KOReader
8. Manual execution and validation: Dry-run mode, sample verification

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Set up Hardcover API authentication and connection (AC 1)
  - [x] Hardcover.app account and API credentials obtained
  - [x] API endpoint(s) documented (GraphQL, REST, or library export)

  - [x] Log fallback matches: matched, unmatched, low-confidence skipped

- [x] Task 6: Implement data source tracking (AC 7)
  - [x] Add or populate `data_source` column in books table (values: 'koreader', 'hardcover', 'calibre')
  - [x] Track enrichment source: 'koreader' for books from ETL, 'hardcover' for new Hardcover books
  - [x] Add enrichment timestamp for audit trail
  - [x] Reference: [Source: docs/guides/SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION.md § Data Provenance]

- [x] Task 7: Implement dry-run mode and validation (AC 8)

  - [x] Manual test: Run dry-run, verify preview accuracy
  - [x] Manual test: Sample 5-10 enriched records, verify against Hardcover.app website
  - [x] Logging shows match counts and any conflicts (if book exists with different metadata)

  - [x] Create `docs/HARDCOVER-ENRICHMENT-SETUP.md` documenting:
    - Purpose and architecture: Hardcover → Books table enrichment
    - API credentials: How to obtain and store securely
    - Configuration: Database credentials, Hardcover API endpoint
    - Manual execution: `python3 /home/alexhouse/resources/scripts/enrich_hardcover_metadata.py --dry-run`
    - Systemd/cron integration (if scheduled)
    - Troubleshooting: API connection issues, match conflicts, ISBN variations
    - Validation queries: Check enriched books count, missing metadata
  - [x] Include SQL validation queries for verification

## Dev Notes

- **Hardcover API Options:**
  - Option 1: GraphQL API (if public endpoint available)
  - Option 2: Personal library export/CSV download (if API limited)
  - Option 3: Web scraping (fallback, if API unavailable)
  - Recommended: Start with official API or documented export format
  - Reference: https://hardcover.app/settings/integrations

- **Data Enrichment Strategy:**
  - Preserve KOReader fields (do not overwrite)
  - Add Hardcover fields: author_id (FK), publisher_id (FK), rating, cover_url, publication_date
  - Conflict resolution: Hardcover is authoritative for metadata fields, KOReader for reading data
  - Avoid duplicate books: ISBN + title + author must be unique

- **Author/Publisher Dimensions:**
  - If Hardcover author not in authors table: INSERT new record
  - If Hardcover publisher not in publishers table: INSERT new record
  - Use existing IDs for matching names (handle variations)
  - Reference: [Source: docs/guides/SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION.md § Authors & Publishers Tables]

- **Testing Standards:**
  - Unit tests for ISBN normalization and fuzzy matching logic
  - Integration tests: Mock Hardcover API response, test enrichment pipeline
  - Manual validation: Compare 10-20 enriched records against Hardcover.app
  - Reference: [Source: docs/testing-strategy.md]

### Project Structure Notes

- **Enrichment script location:** `/home/alexhouse/enrichment/enrich_hardcover_metadata.py` (new, parallel to ETL)
- **Configuration:** Environment variables for API credentials: HARDCOVER_API_KEY, HARDCOVER_ENDPOINT, NEON_HOST, NEON_USER, NEON_PASSWORD, NEON_DATABASE
- **Credentials storage:** `/home/alexhouse/.env.hardcover` (separate from ETL env)
- **Logs:** `/home/alexhouse/logs/hardcover-enrichment.log` (with rotation)
- **Test data:** Sample Hardcover library export stored in `resources/test-data/hardcover-sample.json` for testing

## Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 3.2 (Status: done, completed 2025-10-31)**

Story 3.2 established the ETL pipeline that extracts KOReader reading sessions and loads them into Neon.tech. Key learnings critical to Story 3.3 implementation:

- **Books table created by Story 3.2 ETL:** The `extract_koreader_stats.py` script creates books records with minimal metadata (title, page_count, file_hash, source='koreader'). Story 3.3 will enrich these records with complete Hardcover metadata.
  - Reference: `resources/scripts/extract_koreader_stats.py` classes `KOReaderExtractor` and `DataTransformer`

- **Schema mapping patterns established:** Story 3.2 demonstrates schema transformation patterns that Story 3.3 should follow:
  - Use `DataTransformer` class pattern for ETL operations (flexible, testable)
  - Handle NULL values properly (Hardcover metadata may be incomplete)
  - Use PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT` for duplicate handling
  - Reference: `tests/test_3_2_etl_pipeline.py` test patterns

- **Structured logging module available:** Story 3.2 created a reusable logging pattern with file rotation that Story 3.3 should adopt (do not recreate):
  - Log format: `[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [COMPONENT] message`
  - File rotation: daily, max 10 MB, 7-day retention
  - Reference: `resources/scripts/extract_koreader_stats.py` logging module

- **Neon.tech connectivity proven:** Story 3.2 established database connection patterns with error handling and retry logic. Story 3.3 can reuse these patterns:
  - Connection class: `NeonLoader` with timeout and retry
  - Environment variable management: `Config` class
  - Transaction management: BEGIN → INSERT/UPDATE → COMMIT/ROLLBACK
  - Reference: `resources/scripts/extract_koreader_stats.py` `NeonLoader` and `Config` classes

- **Data validation approach:** Story 3.2 uses dry-run mode (--dry-run flag) for safe testing. Story 3.3 should follow the same pattern:
  - Preview mode shows what would be inserted without writing
  - Integration tests validate transformation logic
  - Reference: `tests/test_3_2_etl_pipeline.py` integration tests

- **Performance expectations:** Story 3.2 runs in <30 seconds. Story 3.3 should aim for similar performance:
  - Expect 500-1500 books in personal Hardcover library
  - Streaming/batched operations for memory efficiency
  - Expected runtime: <60 seconds for typical library enrichment

- **No Hardcover API integration yet:** Story 3.2 does not include Hardcover data (only KOReader + Neon schema). Story 3.3 is the first story to integrate Hardcover API. Plan Hardcover authentication and API discovery as first task.

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan (2025-10-31):**
1. Research Hardcover GraphQL API documentation (resources/HardcoverAPIDocs.md)
2. Follow Story 3.2 ETL pipeline patterns (Config, Extractor, Transformer, Loader architecture)
3. Implement ISBN normalization and fuzzy matching for fallback
4. Add comprehensive test coverage (33 tests across 8 ACs)
5. Create deployment documentation following Story 3.2 standards

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used GraphQL API exclusively (not REST or CSV export) per official Hardcover docs
- Implemented three-tier matching strategy: ISBN → Hardcover ID → Fuzzy title+author
- Used Python's SequenceMatcher for fuzzy matching (no additional Levenshtein dependency needed)
- Connection pooling with 1-5 connections for performance
- Batch pagination: 100 books/request to handle large libraries efficiently

**Architecture:**
- HardcoverExtractor: API client with pagination and error handling
- ISBNMatcher: ISBN normalization and conversion (ISBN-10 ↔ ISBN-13)
- FuzzyMatcher: Title+author similarity with weighted scoring (60% title, 40% author)
- DataTransformer: Map Hardcover schema to Neon.tech schema
- NeonEnricher: Database operations with ON CONFLICT upsert logic
- EnrichmentPipeline: Orchestration with statistics tracking

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for each component class
- Integration tests for end-to-end pipeline
- Mock Hardcover API responses (no live API calls in tests)
- Validated test structure: 33 tests across 9 test classes
- Tests cover all 8 acceptance criteria
